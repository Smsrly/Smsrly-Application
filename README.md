## üõ† Project Architecture

Smsrly employs the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates the application into three main layers:

### üî∏ Data

The data layer contains application data fetched from the API or stored locally. It includes three packages:

- `local`
- `network` (API calls)
- `repository` (implementations of repository interfaces defined in the domain layer)

### üî∏ Presentation

The presentation layer is responsible for displaying data on the screen, including UI elements and ViewModel classes for data management. It consists of two packages:

- `viewmodel`
- `ui` (UI widgets used in the application)

### üî∏ Domain

The domain layer serves as the bridge between the data and presentation layers. It includes three packages:

- `model` (data classes for holding data from the data layer)
- `repository` (repository interfaces abstracting the domain from the data layer)
- `usecase` (use cases or interactors for handling business logic used by multiple ViewModels)

## üìö Packages

Smsrly utilizes various Dart packages to enhance its functionality:

- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
- [Http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)
- [flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) (for responsiveness)
- [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
- [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in)
- [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)
- [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker)
- [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator)
- [carousel_slider](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider)
